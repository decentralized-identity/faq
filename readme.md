This FAQ is built in DIF's Spec-Up micro-CMS, which turns a simple markdown file
into full JS+HTML website to display as a technical specification. It is running
in "single-file" mode, i.e., the entire spec can be found in `docs/spec.md`

Feel free to open issues if you would like to see content or links added. 

To PR in new content, first clone the repo, then run install dependencies locally by running: 
```
$ npm install
$ npm run edit
``` 
Meanwhile, open your local copy of ./index.html in a browser for a live
preview.  Each time you save the underlying markdown files, you can refresh
index.html in your browser to see the page re-rendered by gulp based on the new
input. 

When you are done, simply open a PR to merge your `docs/spec.md` and your new,
re-rendered `./index.html` file to `main` and the live FAQ will be updated
shortly after the PR is accepted. If it sits for more than a week, ping an
editor on DIF Slack!
