expand and read all the 1-star questions first, then reload the page and do the
same for all the 2-star questions, then the 3-stars. They are not sorted by

in various orders. If you don’t understand the placement of chilis warning you

controversies is level 4.  When you not only understand why all those chili are
there, but furthermore feel torn and sympathetic to all parties in each

which organizes the space of decentralized identity into interlocking and
interdependent subsystems. This can be a little “inside baseball” at first, but
with time, the utility and consequence of this layering should grow more
intuitive and less arbitrary. Modeled on the It originated in the DIF

<h5 id="what-is-a-did"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-did" >§</a> What is a DID? 🟢</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, it’s an address on the internet that someone called a <strong>subject</strong> (you, a company, a device) can “own” and control directly, like a username but randomly generated. It can be used to find a connected “DID document” which is like a business card, providing extra information for finding or contacting or checking the signatures of that subject; that subject can update or remove that “listing” over time, directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These  identifiers are called “decentralized” because each is registered and
resolved on autonomous “namespaces” (see below), which are often closely coupled
to specific public-readable DLTs like blockchains or DAGs that, by publishing
addressing records immutably, function as “verifiable data registries” for their
specific kind of identifiers. The most general category, though, is “VDR”
because these do not necessarily have to take the form of blockchains, clouds,
networks, or anything else-- a VDR could be paper-based and still decentralized!
(We would have to name it after Jorge Luis Borges if we made such a registry.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, a DID is a string that functions as an address, but sometimes
people might use the term to refer both to the DID and the DID Document that you
get when you use a “DID Method” to resolve it.  A DID without a DID Document is
like a dead end!</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="what-is-a-did-prefix"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-did-prefix" >§</a> What is a DID “prefix”? 🟢</h5>
<p>Each DID is prefixed with a reference to, and only guaranteed to useful,
meaningful, and reliable within, one DID namespace. If you come across a DID in
the wild, this prefix makes it easy to identify its origin and where to go to
“use” it for fetching a DID Document.  A DID from the Sovrin network, for
example, begins with “did:sov:…”, and one from the Veres One network begins
with “did:v1:…” Each “namespace” (addressing system) is navigated with and
governed by a “DID Method.” Some methods have multiple networks/namespaces, but
each namespace is governed by one method.  A list of all registered prefixes can
be found <a path-0="www.w3.org"path-1="TR"path-2="did-spec-registries"path-3="#did-methods"href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods" >here</a>.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-did-method"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-did-method" >§</a> What is a “DID Method”? 🟢</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>You can think of a DID Method as a black box-- if you type in a DID, you get
back a DID Document. Press the “new DID” button and enter some information,
you will get control of a new DID.  If it’s not a simple machine, it’s not a
very useful DID Method!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each DID is a publically-specified micro-protocol containing namespace rules,
CRUD and resolution mechanics, references to all dependencies such as
standardized cryptographic signatures schemes, and sometimes even models and
algorithms specific to one set of infrastructure such as a blockchain protocol
governed elsewhere. Each “DID method” has unique characteristics and
infrastructures, with particular strengths and weaknesses; even their security
guarantees and privacy engineering vary widely, so it can be dangerous to assume
they are all equal and interchangeable. Each is like a little internet unto
itself!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each “DID method” encodes and specifies a set of interdependent governance,
publication, and discovery mechanisms for DIDs in a given DID namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="what-exactly-is-a-namespace-in-simple-terms"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-exactly-is-a-namespace-in-simple-terms" >§</a> What exactly is a “Namespace”, in simple terms? 🟢</h5>
<p><strong>Namespace</strong> here means a universe of possible names, each of which is unique
and ideally as collision-free as possible, and in most cases completely opaque
and/or non-human-readable. Namespaces can be private or public or have complex
access levels or forwarding systems, but if one name resolves to two different
destinations in the same namespace depending on the context or who’s asking or
random luck, you’ve got a problem! Examples of namespaces include: US phone
numbers, phone numbers in the 415 area code, all the phone numbers on earth,
IPv4 and IPv6, the 5-digit or 9-digit US zip codes, all the postal codes in
Thailand, etc etc.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-verifiable-credentials-vc"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-are-verifiable-credentials-vc" >§</a> What are Verifiable Credentials (“VC”)? 🟢</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, they are a portable list of claims about a subject signed by one or
more authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verifiable Credentials combine properties and superpowers from many different
mental models and forms of prior art; Linked Data, JSON Web Tokens, Ontologies,
ETL systems. They are like portable, free-floating data points, which are not
exactly documents or files or “records” in the usual sense. They are signed and
thus tamper-evident, and thus share much of the verifiability of blockchain data
or signed PDFs insofar as the signatures they contain can be properly verified
by reference to the identities included inside the document.</p>
<p>They can be encrypted or not, they can identify their subject directly or
indirectly using DIDs or any other kind of address and/or indirection mechanism.
They can be public or private or somewhere in between, large or small,
long-lasting or ephemeral. For the different categories or “flavors” of VC, see
the section on Layer 3 below.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-wallet"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-a-wallet" >§</a> What is a Wallet? 🟢</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, a wallet stores magic gibberish passwords (private keys) and magic
fridge-magnet poetry (seed phrases) that help end-users control DIDs and other
kinds of accounts like blockchain addresses or high-security multi-factor
log-ins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Controlling, updating, and proving control of a DID (or, for that matter, a
cryptocurrency address, an NFT, or many other kinds of digital assets) requires
a private key, which isn’t very secure or useful if copies of it are drifting
around the open web like flotsam. For this reason, private keys are managed by
specialized software generally called a “wallet” or an “authenticator”, since
they have to do complex, high-security operations to avoid leaking private keys
while still producing unique signatures with those private keys every time proof
is needed that they possess them (in different context, these private-key
operations can be called “signing”, “authentication”, “interactive proof”, etc).</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1hhKZTWYAA2Eu_?format=jpg&amp;name=small" alt="wallet ux meme"></p>
<p>In the identity context, however, a wallet can also store and present VCs, which
require proof of control of a private key to be considered verifiable at a given
point in time. For this reason, cryptocurrency wallets (that only manage control
keys for cryptocurrency accounts) are usually distinguished from identity
wallets (that control keys for receiving and verifiably presenting verifiable
credentials).  That said, there is no good reason one wallet couldn’t do both,
and some day soon they probably will! See the Layer 4 section for more detail on
wallets in general and the Universal Wallet in particular, and Layer 5 for
architectural questions. Heck, just CTRL-F and search for “wallet”!</p>

<h5 id="what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-did"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-did" >§</a> What is so <em>decentralized</em> about a DID? 🟢</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever heard the phrase, “not your keys, not your account?” The variously
“direct” control of a DID makes it different than identifiers managed by a
central database, registry, or database-- i.e., 99% of today’s identifier
systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes a DID decentralized isn’t the DID itself or what you can do with it,
but how you got the DID and how it relates to the outside world. Each “DID
Method” represents the governance and groundrules of an experimental new form of
addressing system or namespace. How decentralized it is depends on the specific
system, as they are all designed to make specific compromises and design
choices.</p>
<p>In the most decentralized of these, addresses can be
generated and/or registered confidentially by any party, as on public
blockchains; in all, some amount of independence, confidentiality, and privacy
is guaranteed in the registration process. Regardless of how access to
registration of them is gated, DIDs are like email addresses or URLs, except
they return key material for encrypted communications and data operations. Thus,
they enable decentralized communications and identity operations that might
otherwise be hard to build from the ground up. At least, they will, once the
tools DIF is fostering and promoting go mainstream and enable anyone with a DID
to start using it in powerful ways.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-vc"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#what-is-so-decentralized-about-a-vc" >§</a> What is so <em>decentralized</em> about a VC? 🟢</h5>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have two superpowers-- <strong>verifiability</strong> (they are
digitally signed in a tamperproof way, like a signed PDF, which can be verified
independently of and privately from the signer) and <strong>portability</strong> (they are
designed to be interpretable outside of their original context, and contain
mechanisms for reconstructing and interpreting that context independently as
well).</p>
<p>Think of VCs as decentralized data, or if you are coming from the blockchain
world, as <em>off-chain</em> data. You might need to reference one or more verifiable
data registries to fully verify, parse, and consume it, but in and of itself
it’s an atomic little unit of free-floating verifiable data, with long-lasting
and autonomous meaning and value in it. Parsing it with reference to an
immutable or public data source is not the same as needing to confirm its
validity with the central servers of its issuer!  Which brings us to…</p>
<h5 id="the-roles-of-decentralized-verification-aka-the-trust-triangle"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#the-roles-of-decentralized-verification-aka-the-trust-triangle" >§</a> The “roles” of decentralized verification (aka the “trust triangle”) 🟢</h5>
<p>Verifiable Credentials contain information, which is only verifiable relative to
certain roles.  An <strong>Issuer</strong> put that verifiable credential into the world and
signed it-- it contains claims about the world, or more specifically, claims
about one or more data <strong>subjects</strong> (not always human or individual).  Anyone
legitimately consuming or verifying that credential is referred to as a
<strong>Verifier</strong>.  A subject is, or has a verifiable, provable trust relationship
with, a credential’s intended <strong>Holder</strong>; a credential needs to contain some
kind of reference to that holder allowing it to authenticate itself as being
legitimate.  Depending on the use-case, there might be many more than three
stakeholders or topologies represented, but this threesome is the core of the
drama.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Importantly, <em>Issuers and Verifiers are variously firewalled</em> from one another
in SSI thinking. If a verifier know too much about the issuer, or the issuer
knew too much about which verifiers are seeing their credentials, all of this
work and complexity would be hard to justify! That firewall is essential to the
empowerment of the holder and/or subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="is-decentralized-identity-a-philosophy-or-a-technology"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#is-decentralized-identity-a-philosophy-or-a-technology" >§</a> Is <em>decentralized identity</em> a philosophy or a technology? 🟡🔥</h5>
<p>Decentralization (or, in its more emphatic and radical form,
re-decentralization) is a broad philosophy that sees distributing power and data
more horizontally as a societal goal, an economic goal, and/or a technological
goal. Most people working in this space consider themselves to be working
towards that end, but not everyone agrees on exactly what it should look like,
nor on whether everyone else in the space is likely making a net-positive
contribution to it!  Ideology is tricky that way.</p>
<p>More importantly, it is DIF’s position that the technology we support and foster
is a necessary but insufficient means to that end; we do not want to
overpromise, so we consider any good-faith effort at decentralization that
relies on the building blocks of DIDs and/or VCs to be within our scope and
remit. We are a technology organization, so our boundaries are set by the
standardization done to date centered on the W3C specifications, not by
ideological definitions.</p>
<h5 id="is-decentralized-identity-different-from-self-sovereign-identity"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#is-decentralized-identity-different-from-self-sovereign-identity" >§</a> Is <em>decentralized</em> identity different from <em>self-sovereign</em> identity? 🟡🔥</h5>
<p>The two building blocks of DIDs and VCs, which decentralize
addressing/identifier systems and make data portable and verifiable, enable new,
decentralized ways of representing and protecting data and structuring software.
These tools can be applied to individual human identity use-cases, but they can
be applied to collective non-human identities as well. Sovereignty and privacy
are social values that can be confusing when describing a tax record, or a
non-profit corporation, or a DAO or a smart meter; in these cases, independence,
confidentiality, and autonomy are more useful technological terms.  All of these
are use-cases for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Certain codifications of these decentralized ways of handling claims about and
communications with humans are referred to as “self-sovereign,” with varying
degrees of technological specificity.  Since these codifications are not
primarily technological but belong to human values and social structures, it is
difficult for DIF to draw the boundary between what is or is not a
“self-sovereign” use of decentralized identity technologies. Our scope and remit
is properly technological, so we are eagerly supportive of all decentralized
identity technologies, whether they be supportive of self-sovereign applications
or not.</p>

<p>Using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) does

<p>Either, depending on your attitude and your use cases! Identity and Access
Management tends to be associated with centralized hierarchies of delegation
(i.e., the “Access Control List” approach, credentials that “phone home” to
their issuer at each use, etc.). Centralized and/or “Federated” architectures
are common in today’s IAM, but they are not inherent to IAM: many IAM companies
are rolling out products and systems for managing and provisioning decentralized
identities and/or verifiable credentials at enterprise scale. If those
identities and credentials are portable and interoperable, that’s decentralized
enough for this decentralized identity foundation! But for many use-cases or
ideologies, any “go-between” or mediation is too much, particularly when it
comes to censorship-resistance or anonymity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IAM can be more or less decentralized, and decentralized tools can be used to
centralized ends. Technological decentralization doesn’t guarantee
decentralization of business models or power structures in the real world! And
it might not even be a good thing if they did. 🔥</p>

<p>They are! VCs are neutral and un-opinionated by design as to what kinds of
identifier URIs are provided for issuer and holder identification. DID methods
could be designed to use x.509 structures to manage key material for DIDs, or
simply contain x.509 addresses in their DID:Documents.  For bibliography on
eIDAS and DIDs, see the <a path-0="www.thedinglegroup.com"path-1="blog"path-2="2021"path-3="3"path-4="11"path-5="eidas-and-self-sovereign-identity"href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/blog/2021/3/11/eidas-and-self-sovereign-identity" >Vienna Identity

<p>Whether or not a specific x.509 system is decentralized enough, or private
enough, is up for debate-- but there is no technological conflict, and plenty of
work has been commissioned by governments around the world to align their
existing identity/transaction auditing infrastructures with this new paradigm

<blockquote>
<p>DOIs are static and centrally managed/overseen; DIDs are self-managed and
self-updateable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital Object Identifiers (<a path-0="www.doi.org"path-1=""href="https://www.doi.org/" >DOIs</a>) are the most famous
form of persistent identifier, and differ in two main aspects from decentralized
identifiers: on the one hand, they are very centralized, in that one global
registry of all DOIs is maintained and governed by a non-profit called the
International DOI Foundation or
<a path-0="www.doi.org"path-1="doi_handbook"path-2="7_IDF.html"href="https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html" >IDF</a>. On the other, they are
static in both senses of the word: they are neither updatable/reusable nor
interactive, which are the two main superpowers of DIDs.</p>
<p>There are, however, many more persistent identifiers, some of them less
centralized and some of them more interactive or dynamic. Indeed, a whole
community working with such “PIDs” exist, primarily in the fields of library
science, academic publishing, and other fields where unique identifiers and
namespaces for opaque identifiers are of paramount importance. For more
information about that other world, see Markus Sabadello’s article on our blog,

<p>Whoever creates a method and documents it is expected to register it if they
want anyone to use it and consider it a method for broad use. There is no
central committee deciding what DID methods are legitimate or not-- each Method
is responsible for its own specification, governance, and maintenance/evolution;
registration is not evaluative, merely an aid to discovery and interoperability.
To get evaluative feedback or peer review before publishing a method, open
standards venues like ours here at the DIF are the best place to compare notes

<p>All methods are expected to be maintainers of systems and infrastructure that
are built on top of them. They are each specified by a published, registered,
and ideally well-maintained <strong>specification</strong>. This specification explains how
to validate a DID (namespace rules), where to query and what to expect back when
resolving a DID, etc. The

</blockquote>
<p>Remember, A DID is any address that can be turned into a usable and conformant
DID Document, and there are many drastically different ways of doing this that
can confuse new-comers to the space by all being grouped under the broad
category of DIDs. For example, most DID methods use blockchains or other
publicly-readable verifiable data registries directly (or indirectly, in the
case of “layer 2” systems based on DIF’s <a path-0="identity.foundation"path-1="sidetree"path-2="spec"path-3=""href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/" >Sidetree
Protocol</a> ) but some, such as
<a path-0="w3c-ccg.github.io"path-1="did-method-web"path-2=""href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/" ><code>DID:Web</code></a>, use other systems of
verification, such as TLS-secured DNS resolution. There are also “deterministic”
DID methods like <a href="" ><code>DID:key</code></a> and <code>DID:pkh</code> that produce a DID Document without
any verifiable registry from a pre-existing public key for interoperability
purposes, and “off-chain” or “ephemeral” methods like
<a path-0="identity.foundation"path-1="peer-did-method-spec"href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec" >DID:Peer</a> that produce a
single-use, private DID Document corresponding to private keys generated at
runtime for private connections. DID:Peer DIDs are integral to DIDComm, which is
one key way to allow routing and messaging across these addressing systems en
masse rather than having to resolve them one by one and figure out routing and
messaging based on their various privacy, discovery, routing, and security
properties.</p>

<p>Most people presume only one DID method will be enough for a given product,

requires at least a passive level of support (i.e., resolution), and being able
to issue VCs to holders of multiple kinds of identifiers (including but not

<p>This is a very complex question, and one which DIF cannot give advice in a way
that is neutral and fair to all its members. There are, however, a number of

<p>DIF Member Eric Welton presented at the January 2021 F2F a project called the
DID Method Dataset, which is a “Community Journalism” model. The idea there is
to set up google forms to mirror both the W3C DID Rubric as well as
“professional question sets” - the answers to these questions. one early

<p>This is, again, too large a question for a one-paragraph answer. But
understanding the requirements of a given use-case or problem space takes time

storage of some kind?</li>
<li>Are VC’s revocable? How?</li>
<li>Does the DID layer support selective disclosure (including ZKP or specific
forms of ZKP)?</li>
<li>Does the DID layer include mechanisms for storing and referencing semantics
(i.e. credential definitions)? Is it a required mechanism?</li>

<p>The open-endedness and extensibility of DIDs is liberating, daunting, and
staggeringly complex. What can you put into a DID Doc? What are the tradeoffs?
How do people protect or compensate for the privacy and security risks of
putting more into the Doc? These are massive questions, way beyond an FAQ. A
hopefully smaller question is whether the overhead and interoperability costs of
creating a new method outweigh adapting an existing method: whether you land on
a yes or a no or somewhere in between, a thorough review of prior art is still
the next step, whether to reuse or reimplement.  Such a review can be
eye-opening and fortify the design process in a lot of unexpected ways.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Self-certifying identifiers are deterministically derived from public keys, such
that they can be widely published and control of the public key from which they
derive can be proven with its corresponding private key. They are
&quot;self-&quot;certifying in the same way that DIDs generally require reading a
blockchain or other verifiable data registry to certify-- the identifier itself,
being a hash or other deterministic derivation of the public key, validates the
public key.</p>
<p>Not all SCIDs are DIDs, and not all DIDs are SCIDs. There are DID methods that
make sure all its DIDs are SCIDs, such as any DID method based on the Sidetree

<p>Yes-- but it can also NOT be a SCID.  Two DIF work items, the Sidetree Protocol

context and SCIDs that are DIDs within a certain context, respectively.

<p>An emerging category of DID-like things is AIDs, or <strong>Autonomous Identifiers</strong>,
which do not depend on a verifiable data registry to be trustworthy, instead
maintaining and deliverying their own “self-certifying” DID Document, and
optionally an entire self-certifying <em>history</em> of that DID Document as well.
These verbose, historical DID Documents can be conceived of as “microledgers,”as

the internet stack that we non-specialists rarely think about or even know by

redundancy services, network routing. Agent frameworks allow lightweight
frontends like single-page apps or decentralized apps (dApps) to interact
directly and discretely with each other and verifiable data registries while
exposing less information and correlation risk than if they went through
conventional clouds and server infrastructures.</p>

kinds of scalable moving parts, or it can be an SDK that takes advantage of the

complexity, lines of code, and independence from infrastructure.  They also have
very different assumptions about topography, how to handle security and routing

<blockquote>
<p>How can I choose between frameworks? This feels like an even bigger commitment than a choice of DID method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might in fact be a bigger commitment! That said, many frameworks listed above
are deliberately modular and open-ended, allowing not just forking and
customization, but even recombination between them. Frameworks are not as
binding as they were a year ago, and will likely be even less so a year from
now: they are a growth hack and a means to greater decentralization, in the long
view.  Open source is all about trust, after all!</p>

Is it smart to try to make one agent/framework to rule them all? 🟡🔥</h5>
<p>No one is trying to make that! Agent frameworks have varying degrees of
interoperability planned on their published roadmaps, and many will likely
support DIDComm, Presentation Exchange, and other common protocols at <em>some</em>
level, for inter-framework VC exchange and other interoperability/cross-auditing
purposes. See discussion of this topic

<p>There are many use-cases where agents bring more complexity or performance
issues than they are worth; they are particularly well-suited to human-identity
use-cases, high-privacy use-cases, and large ecosystems that are homogenous in
terms of decentralized identity tooling and formats.</p>
<p>Importantly, much of the ambition and innovation of the Aries ecosystem is that
it makes today’s client/server and HTTP-based architecture somewhat
<em>optional</em>— over time, the ambition of of Aries is to be forward-compatible
with more horizontal, more peer-to-peer, and differently-scalable architectures.
This is no small feature! It does, however, require some complex and DID-centric
<em>routing</em> mechanisms, which are perhaps the most complex part of DIDComm
messaging.  Depending on the time-scale of your project, this kind of
forward-compatibility might be a stitch in time, or an optional feature you
can’t afford to support in the short term.</p>
<h5 id="is-the-svip-program-a-framework"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#is-the-svip-program-a-framework" >§</a> Is the SVIP program a framework?</h5>
<p>Not exactly-- the Silicon Valley Innovation Project and the Department of
Homeland Security grants it administers are structured as an incubator for
contractors, resulting in a cooperatively-designed test harness and
interoperability profile and supporting LD/Schemata tooling but not an
overarching “framework” codebase per se.</p>
<p>The program’s structure encourages open specification, early and open standards,
and co-development but also requires independent implementations at every layer
and good separation of concerns, with a lot of effort put into preventing vendor
lock-in, dependency management, and standardized interfaces and APIs. Some would
go so far as to call it an “anti-framework” in that what coordination there has
been between developers there has happened slowly and organically and there is
no overarching documentation or entrance point like the frameworks mentioned
above. In large part, the co-development, learning, and design has been lead by
longtime program participants and W3C-CCG contributors Digital Bazaar. DB
founder and CEO Manu Sporny gave a detailed <a path-0="www.din.foundation"path-1="initiativ"path-2="tps-meeting-april"href="https://www.din.foundation/initiativ/tps-meeting-april" >testimonial and

<p>So far, verification of “foreign” VC formats (and “representations”) from other
systems has been slow to be fully integrated into frameworks, but great progress
is being made-- DIF is optimistic that this answer will have to be completely
rewritten by 2022. DIF member Animo Solutions has built LD VC support into Aries
Cloud Agent Python (and hopefully the other Aries agents will soon follow suit).
Furthermore, DIF member <a path-0="bloom.co"path-1=""href="https://bloom.co/" >Bloom</a> has been driving some <a path-0="github.com"path-1="hellobloom"path-2="waci-demo"href="https://github.com/hellobloom/waci-demo" >WACI

Exchange specification to facilitate the initiation and negotiation of
exchanges, which is feeding into a new C&amp;C work item, which might well pave the
way to full VC-HTTP-API support across frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>“Connection”</strong> is very much an Aries-centric concept: it is an abstraction of a
relationship between two identifiers/data subjects, first described in an <a path-0="github.com"path-1="hyperledger"path-2="aries-rfcs"path-3="blob"path-4="master"path-5="features"path-6="0160-connection-protocol"path-7="README.md"href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md" >Aries
RFC</a>.
Its purpose is to establish persistent, end-to-end encrypted messaging based on DIDs.
A more generic version of the concept is included in the <a path-0="w3c-ccg.github.io"path-1="universal-wallet-interop-spec"path-2="#connection"href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#connection" >Universal Wallet draft

<h5 id="do-i-need-a-connection-to-exchange-vcs"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#do-i-need-a-connection-to-exchange-vcs" >§</a> Do I need a connection to exchange VCs?</h5>
<p>Technically, one does not exchange VCs over a “connection,” even if the process
can be described colloquially using this construction. Instead, an Aries
connection is how exchange protocols are initiated and expressed to an end-user;
for the actual mechanics of transport protocols, see the relevant
<a path-0="github.com"path-1="hyperledger"path-2="aries-rfcs"path-3="blob"path-4="master"path-5="features"path-6="0160-connection-protocol"path-7="README.md#0-invitation-to-connect"href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md#0-invitation-to-connect" >subprotocols</a>
and Aries RFCs. Even in Aries, first establishing a formal connection is not a requirement for exchanging VCs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you store persistent identifiers locally or not, and whether or not that storage conforms to portability and recovery data models calling them “connections”, the connection doesn’t exchange credentials-- a protocol does. See the next layer for discussions about those.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="is-a-connection-an-alias-a-contact"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#is-a-connection-an-alias-a-contact" >§</a> Is a connection an alias? A contact?</h5>
<p>A connection is a kind of alias, with special properties and guarantees about
portability, routing, and privacy. There are other ways of storing aliases and
addresses, though; they can be more or less specified, more or less portable,
more or less interoperable, and more or less specific to a given network,
infrastructure, and/or DID method.</p>
<p>A little further afield of the SSI world proper, in the ActivityPub community
which develops tooling for bottom-up/community-driven federated social media and
micropublication systems, there is a related notion of “<a path-0="socialhub.activitypub.rocks"path-1="t"path-2="petnames-gui"path-3="1066"href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/petnames-gui/1066" >pet

interest to connection &amp; UX researchers: these are local aliases for
opaque/privacy-preserving identifiers, with certain best practices and privacy
models baked in.</p>

<p>Much like “connections”, there is very little starting point for a universal
standard, and most blockchain systems and smart-contracting languages try to
tackle this problem from one angle or another to “compete” on key management
guarantees and structures anyways. Universalizing any aspect of cryptography is
very tricky but there are definitely ways to align without boiling the ocean.
Suffice it to say that mileage may vary so do your own research and consult a
professional before making any security guarantees!</p>

<p>The diversity of infrastructures, use-cases, and business models make this a
very ambitious thing to align on within our space. In fact, even aligning some
small subset or corner of the space in this way would be difficult in a way that
is neutral and fair to our whole membership! The problem of upgrading society to
be private-key-based and the software industry to adapt its structures and user
experience norms to match is a huge task, far bigger than decentralized identity
and we cannot expect it to be standardized in our small community.</p>
<p>That said,  specifying and aligning amongst ourselves and watching closely as
the cryptocurrency and cybersecurity worlds progress towards their own
alignments and specifications will be a major task in the coming years.</p>

encoding systems from 4 different operating systems or file systems. They have
slightly different relationships to external semantic anchoring, which makes
translating <em>losslessly</em> between them or “roundtripping” a very tricky, but not
impossible, technical problem. Most of today’s solutions opt to translate with a
little loss if it is acceptable to their usecases. DIF Interop WG has hosted a

<p>Technically, there is none! VCs work great with DIDs used as the identifiers for
issuer and verifier, but they also work with many other kinds of identifiers
(Solid addresses, centralized and local identifier schemes,
blockchain/smart-contract addresses, etc). DIDs can be used for all kinds of
verifications, which is why the “verification method” system of associating
multiple keys of different types with each DID is so flexible; signing VCs is
only one of many purposes.  That said, the designers of both always had the
other front-of-mind, and the complementarity of design thinking is hard to deny
or overlook.</p>

<p>That is…a big question-- read through the rest of this section and ask me
again later. Suffice it to say you need to account for both the semantics and
the syntax of a VC to translate between VC systems. If you are translating to or
from JSON-LD systems or Aries systems, be sure to read those “Advanced Topics”
sections as well before the “Advanced Topics: VC Translation” section.</p>
<h5 id="the-semantics-and-the-what-now-schemata-arent-enough"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#the-semantics-and-the-what-now-schemata-arent-enough" >§</a> The semantics and the what now? Schemata aren’t enough? 🟢</h5>
<p>Traditional data schemata are used to express (and thus validate against that
expression) the <strong>syntax</strong> of data objects-- the type, length, form,
presence/absence, etc of values in the key/value pairs that make up most data
structures. Translation between different kinds of VCs requires explicit
understanding of both syntax and <strong>semantics</strong>– what fields mean, how to
interepret content.</p>
<p>The primary function of JSON-LD “contexts” (complex JSON objects referenced by
the mandatory JSON-LD key “@Context”) is to express the <strong>semantics</strong> of the
keys of the rest of the LD object that it’s in. This reinforces and makes more
explicit “ontological” assumptions about what data can mean, which facilitates
the translation between schemata or systems and the reconstruction of lost or
foreign contexts in the case these are lost.</p>
<h5 id="so-what-exactly-is-json-ld-then-if-not-a-kind-of-json"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#so-what-exactly-is-json-ld-then-if-not-a-kind-of-json" >§</a> So what exactly is JSON-LD, then, if not a kind of JSON? 🟡</h5>
<p>JSON-LD is a way of encoding complex, semantically-disambiguated information
about data in a variant or a subset of the the handy JSON format that developers
interact with all the time. The underlying, graph-structured information can be
composed and navigated like a graph using RDF, without necessarily requiring the
developer to go down the RDF rabbithole-- it does this by constraining JSON in a
form where it can be parsed as, or converted to, RDF.  In fact, a version of an
LD document that has been converted to RDF (or at least, that can be treated as
RDF by standard RDF tooling) is referred to as an “<strong>expanded version</strong>”.</p>
<p>A JSON LD document looks like a regular JSON blob except for a few
eccentricities (like the mandatory @Context key/value pair), but works quite
differently under the hood.  Processing an LD blob as it if were a vanilla JSON
blob can lead to confusion and bad interoperability. For more information, see
“Advanced Topics: JSON-LD”.</p>
<h5 id="do-i-have-to-use-json-ld-to-use-vcs-️"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#do-i-have-to-use-json-ld-to-use-vcs-️" >§</a> Do I <em>have</em> to use JSON-LD to use VCs? 🟠️ 🔥🔥</h5>
<p>Yes and no-- the Verifiable Credentials <a path-0="www.w3.org"path-1="TR"path-2="vc-data-model"path-3=""href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" >data model
specification</a>, currently in Candidate
Recommendation stage of approval at the W3C, relies upon the JSON-LD standard,
and all its examples presume conformant LD. Being able to design and issue
conformant LD is not the duty of each individual system, however-- there are
many ways to arrive at the goal of VCs being encoded in that way.</p>
<p>There are other systems for expressing semantics for data, such as the young
IETF standard
<a path-0="json-schema.org"path-1="learn"path-2="getting-started-step-by-step.html"href="https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html" >JSON-Schema</a>
which does not require keys to be defined against public (i.e. web-published)
definitions and that does not require/assume the immutable publication of
contexts for signatures to be long-lived. This may be simpler and easier for
some use-cases but may inhibit interoperability with LD-based systems and the
vocabularies of organizations like the W3C and GS1. Like JSON-LD Schemata, JSON
Schema objects require special linters and validators, which can be found in the
<a path-0="extendsclass.com"path-1="json-schema-validator.html"href="https://extendsclass.com/json-schema-validator.html" >JSON Schema Section</a> at
<a path-0="extendsclass.com"href="http://extendsclass.com" ><span>extendsclass.com</span></a> . Some DIF work items like the <a path-0="identity.foundation"path-1="credential-manifest"path-2=""href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/" >Credential
Manifest</a> use JSON Schema for
semantic anchoring extensively. The trick is getting those other ways of
expressing semantics into a shape that other SSI systems and VC consumers can
interpret.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That sounds hard, and/or I don’t think my boss/investors/CISO would like that.
Is JSON-LD the only way to express semantics? Do I need to output JSON-LD
somehow to have interoperability with other systems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the low-level VC libraries in the Aries ecosystem
abstract out much of the complexity specific to LD and semantic anchoring.  In
the case of Indy-based systems, there are specific layers of blockchain-based
semantic and syntactic annotation that frame verifiable presentations (See below
under Advanced Topics: Credential Definitions). See

<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs refers to a mathematical construct, which is at the heart
of many cryptographic systems such as the control privacy-preserving mechanisms
in such “blinded transaction” blockchains as ZCash. It refers to mathematical or
data operations, not to high-level protocols such as credential exchange or
proofing claims or real-world exchanges.</p>
<p>Selective Disclosure, on the other hand, refers to real-world exchanges or
information exchanges.  In the VC context, presenting information contained in a
verifiable credential selectively, in a way that still allows the credential as
a whole to be cryptographically proofed and verified, usually relies on some
form of ZKP cryptography.  There are different styles of ZKP and different
styles of Selective Disclosure, so it helps to be precise about exactly which
kind you are talking about, as they all have distinct properties and guarantees,
scalability issues, etc.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity world, the most common selective disclosure
mechanisms (each with their own distinct Verifiable Presentation mechanisms!)
are:</p>

<p>Fetching new contexts and revocation lists at runtime is generally frowned upon
and could raise serious privacy and security issues in a production environment;
for this reason, JSON-LD, like most graph-model data systems, makes extensive
use of caching, pre-loading, and periodically refreshing its dependencies to
build a “local graph.” One crucial building-block in such a secure pre-loading
system specific to the JSON-LD concept of a “document” is the “document loader”
described in many specifications and tutorials on how to build for JSON-LD
verification. DIF hosts a general-purpose reference

<p>Basically, the process of creating schemata (whether for syntax, for semantics,
or both) is best thought of as a <em>recombinatory</em> process-- mixing and matching
composable prior art and adding properties or methods to existing building
blocks is the name of the game, and the more you can recycle or use common
building blocks, the better. Developers often refer to this as “extending
classes,” i.e. adding properties and methods to a pre-existing object.</p>
<p>Most schema development for JSON-LD projects (whether for shape, for semantics,
or both) starts with a bit of reading on <a path-0="Schema.org"href="http://Schema.org" ><span>Schema.org</span></a>’s <a path-0="schema.org"path-1="docs"path-2="documents.html"href="https://schema.org/docs/documents.html" >reference
shelf</a> and search function results, or a
few other major ontologies/contexts like the <a path-0="www.heppnetz.de"path-1="projects"path-2="goodrelations"path-3=""href="http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/" >HeppNetz Good Relations
</a>vocabulary for e-Commerce or
the <a path-0="www.gs1.org"path-1="epcis"path-2="epcis"path-3="1-1"href="https://www.gs1.org/epcis/epcis/1-1" >EPCIS</a> standard for describing
business processes and events. Once you have a skeleton that maps <em>most</em> of the
relevant data for your use case in standardized terms, you’re ready to start
extending!</p>
<p>Extensions can remain specific to a given project if your project hosts its own
vocabulary that extends the standard one, or (with appropriate resources and timelines)
you can propose your extensions “to origin” at
<a path-0="schema.org"path-1="docs"path-2="extension.html"href="https://schema.org/docs/extension.html" >schema.org</a> or elsewhere. When
self-hosting, remember to configure your web server to serve LD files as
MIME-type json+ld (you might also want to get fancy with <a path-0="github.com"path-1="w3c-ccg"path-2="vc-http-api"path-3="pull"path-4="158#issue-588951741"href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/158#issue-588951741" >versioning

<p>Another place to look is the vocabularies established in the W3C-CCG, some of
which, such as the traceability vocabulary, have their own unique generators for
creating and testing LD schemata from conventional “data shape” schemata in
JSON. An example of the stages of generation can be found

<p>The core VC libraries of the Hyperledger Aries project work on a kind of hybrid
“credential definition” that includes both semantic and syntactic definitions of
what can go into a given VC. Credential Definitions are more like syntax
schemata, and <a path-0="github.com"path-1="hyperledger"path-2="aries-rfcs"path-3="blob"path-4="master"path-5="concepts"path-6="0250-rich-schemas"path-7="README.md"href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0250-rich-schemas/README.md" >Rich

derived from conformant VCs to create LD framing in the presentation process.

<p>VCs are not only validated directly against JSON-LD or JSON Schema, but the
CL-ZKP algorithms available in the Aries libraries use the CD and RS definitions
to allow for verifiable selective disclosure of subsets of credential data via
“framing”-- this process requires the definition as one of the inputs, however,
so Indy-conformant credential definitions must be used from the same Indy-based
ledger that stores the rest of the ingredients in the presentation. These have
historically been written to a given Indy blockchain, but other forms of
immutable/highly-available storage are being pioneered in the Aries ecosystem.</p>

<p>The sky is the limit–all kinds of form factors and software contexts are in
various stages of prototyping an standardization!  In fact, many people use the
word “wallet” to refer to all kinds software, including libraries and widgets
working invisibly inside other software. There are browser-based wallets (that
store keys in the browser, whether temporarily or permanently), cloud-based
wallets (that rely on “cloud HSMs” and other cloud-native secure keystores and
have a conventional account structure per user), mobile apps (that may use
biometrics, on-device cryptography, etc).  There are combinations and
synchronization/replication systems spanning 2 or 3 of those.  There are even
on-premise systems for issuance and verification, which might produce and
consume VCs without a conventional individual/edge wallet ever coming into play.
There are many many nails that this hammer is good for!</p>
<h5 id="crypto-wallets-vs-identity-wallet-️"><a class="toc-anchor" href="#crypto-wallets-vs-identity-wallet-️" >§</a> Crypto wallets vs Identity wallet 🟡️</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>Do concepts from cryptocurrency wallets like “cold storage”, “air gapping”,
and “custodial wallet” apply to identity wallets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no–in some use cases, the distinctions can be quite meaningful because
they signal different architectures, security guarantees, relations of power
between stakeholders, etc etc.  In particular, SSI use cases about direct,
interactive control of credentials by individual humans lend themselves quite
well to these analogies, and web-based wallets (with the actual private key
controlled by a trusted service provider, a hardware security module, a cold
storage device, etc) can be understood as less directly human-controlled.  In
other use cases, though, the analogy can be confusing or distracting, so don’t
expect them to be useful everywhere!</p>

<p>Actually, this answer cannot be answered definitively-- the terms are, in some
sense, still shifting and drifting over time as our nascent “market” changes
shape and needs; they might never truly settle, because both “wallet” and
“agent” are complex and multivalent terms already in the history of software,
which mean very different things in nearby contexts.  For instance, in browser
terminology, an “agent” is any daemon or widget that reliably represents or
serves a distant party (usually human) in a fiduciary or remote-control
capacity; in legal terms, an agent is anything that acts on another’s behalf;
etc etc.  A whole survey-based research project of DIF’s Glossary Group tried to
suss out who used the term how in our community and descriptively map the
schools of thought (see the 📄<a path-0="identity.foundation"path-1="assets"path-2="glossary-group-report--may-2020.pdf"href="https://identity.foundation/assets/glossary-group-report--may-2020.pdf" >final
report</a>
for a skimmable overview).  It’s not necessarily a bad thing that no
cross-community concensus ever arose!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many wallet should there be in the future? How many will there be in, say,
2 or 10 or 20 years?**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I marked this question with two chilis because “browsers” were the battleground
of Web 1.0 and “apps” were the battleground of Web 2.0, leaving many to
speculate that wallets and/or blockchains will be the battlegrounds of Web 3.0.
Drummond Reed of Evernym and the ToIP Foundation even gave a talk on the <a path-0="uto.asu.edu"path-1="features"path-2="move-over-browsers-future-internet-digital-wallets"href="https://uto.asu.edu/features/move-over-browsers-future-internet-digital-wallets" >Coming

Wars</a>;
it stands to reason that whoever owns and governs the major wallets (and thus
the end-user’s UX, which seeps into and influences the whole culture and
ideology of the digital world) will be well-positioned in our decentralized
future! While DIF’s focus is mostly on paving the highways and freeways rather
than on designing the cars, UX has its place at DIF (the Product Managers
group), and as any UX designer can tell you, you can’t leave UX thinking for
last!</p>
<p>All that said, DIF is a member organization and cannot speculate on the shape of
competition between its members. Wallets play such an integral role in the
business models and market dynamics of our members’ work that we can only signal
the consequence of wallet design and encourage its member to collaborate and
co-develop wallets and common wallet libraries and components openly.</p>

<p>This is a matter of some debate, and like privacy and other psychological and/or

highly specific to their underlying social, legal, political,  economic, and
even medical realities.  There is plenty of work ongoing in our community on

as a techno-social construct (and legal corollary to assumptions about the
agency of the “user” in software thinking), to give just one example, and the
use of biometrics or mnemonics to prove, maintain, and exert control over a DID
will likely need to be advanced and standardized before decentralized identity
architectures can be brought to the huge fraction of the world’s population with
low chances of owning a cryptographically enabled personal phone or computer.</p>

<p>Depending on what information needs to be live for a given use-case, and how
live/fresh it needs to be, verification can be more or less “offline”.  For
instance, if a verifier has all the information it needs about a known and
finite set of issuers, it can verify the authenticity of a VC offline-- and
depending on what information the holder of that credential can present along
with it, they can also verify that it was indeed issued to them.  Checking the
status of mutable-status (i.e., revocable) credentials offline is another tricky
matter, but here as everywhere, it depends on the requirements of the usecase–
if revocation lists can be updated once a day, the 23 hours between updates
verification can happen live and offline!</p>

<p>Legalizing any load-bearing, high-value technology is slow and complex work that
takes a lot of hands-- first, exact definitions and specifications are needed,
as well as standardizations, longitudinal assesments, academic studies, impact
reports, that kind of thing.  Even after all that is squared away and packaged
up to adequately prepare regulators to do their work, they in turn take their
own time to harmonize many different specialists and stakeholders, before they
can present somethign to politicians, who have their own games to play and
interests to align.  All the market forces in the world, perfectly aligned, can
only speed these processes up so much.</p>
<p>All that said, encryption has been around a long time, and personal data, and
direct control mechanisms, and privacy laws.  All of these exist in regulatory
frameworks and relatively stable, regulated marketplaces for software that
structure all of this at national or global scale. When you combine these
regulatory frameworks with certification schemes and the kind of fair-play
pressures and norms that Better Business Bureaus and guilds enforce, you’ve got
a <strong>Trust Framework</strong>, which in layman’s terms tells you how much to trust each
link in a chain of data, contracts, and service/fiduciary relationships. How
much liability can a bank outsource to the software providers that make its
mobile app? Which digital signatures hold up in court? What’s an acceptible
margin of error when identifying people, or vouching for the soundness of their
paperwork? These are all norms set by a Trust Framework, which might govern a
nation-state or an industry within one or a global software market.</p>

Frameworks and regulatory matters is the <a path-0="kantarainitiative.org"path-1=""href="https://kantarainitiative.org/" >Kantara
Initiative</a>, primarily active and influential
in the English-speaking world. They have even authored meta-frameworks that
offer building blocks for more active frameworks in specific jurisdictions,
such as their <a path-0="kantarainitiative.org"path-1="idassurance"path-2=""href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/" >Identity Assurance
Framework</a>; they also incubated,
standardized, and govern an Authorization framework called <a path-0="kantarainitiative.org"path-1="confluence"path-2="display"path-3="uma"path-4="Home"href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home" >User Managed
Access</a>, which laid
important technical and social groundwork for the technologies and ideas of
decentralized identity.</p>

<p>Traditional IAM is governed by many robust, decades-old languages, vocabularies,
registries, and other standards like
<a path-0="en.wikipedia.org"path-1="wiki"path-2="XACML"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML" >XACML</a>. If you are new to these standards,
take seriously the research effort it will take to familiarize yourself with
them! Many of these considerations are discussed in the Wallet Security WG that
works on compliance and legacy support issues.</p>

section</a>
of the WG’s homepage is a good overview of how complicated and hard it is to
herd the cats of our community and broker common goals and definitions.  For an
explanation of the current state of those negotiations, see our recent <a path-0="blog.identity.foundation"path-1="setting-interoperability-targets"path-2=""href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/" >blog
